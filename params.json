  "body": "# SweetSpot: Near Infrared Survey of Type Ia Supernova in the Nearby Smooth Hubble Flow\r\n\r\nSweetSpot was a 3-year survey that collected 114 Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) located in the nearby smooth Hubble flow over 88 nights using the WIYN High Resolution Infrared Camera (WHIRC) mounted on the WIYN 3.5 m Telescope located on Kitt Peak.\r\n\r\n## About\r\nThe goals of this survey are to\r\n\r\n1. Extend NIR Hubble diagram out to z~0.08\r\n2. Quantitatively test how standard SNeIa are in the NIR\r\n3. Provide insights into the color involution of SNeIa\r\n4. Study dust in other galaxies\r\n5. Explore correlations of NIR SNeIa with host galaxy properites\r\n6. Provide a well-calibrated low-redshift anchor for future, potentially space-based surveys\r\n\r\n## Published Papers\r\nPilot : [Weyant et al 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3828)\r\n\r\nComing Soon: Weyant et al 2016 - The First Data Release from SweetSpot: 74 Supernovae in 29 Nights on WIYN+WHIRC\r\n\r\n## Data Products\r\nPilot paper: Raw data is located on NOAO archives. Lightcurves published in paper. \r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nPrincipal Investigator: W. Michael Wood-Vasey (@wmwv), U.
